Notes for Hackers
-----------------

Here are some quick notes, that may or may not evolve into something more
substantial over time. Development is preferably done via git merges.

* git trees don't contain pre-built config/Makefiles/etc. You'll need to
  run the following (in order):

      aclocal -I m4
      automake --add-missing --copy
      autoconf

  You can also run "autoreconf -i" to perform these three stages.

* Regression tests can be run as follows (try --help for more details):

      tests/runtests

* Documentation is in SGML source in doc/ so don't edit *.8, *.5 directly.

Prior to a new release:

	Update configure.ac with new version
	commit git tree to appropriate branch (dev/master/topic)
	perform a final tests/runtests on the tree
	push tree up to git.kernel.org
	prep tree for tarball (git archive)
	sign tree with GPG and save signature
	push archive up to kernel.org
